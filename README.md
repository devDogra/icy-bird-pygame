The objective of the game is to control a bird and dodge obstacles that come in its way to get the highest score possible.
The game was made using the PyGame module in Python. Almost all graphical assets are original creations, with the exception of the bird. The sound effects have been sourced from the original Flappy Bird assets, and the music is a track freely available for use.
